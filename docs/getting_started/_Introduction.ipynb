        "Many processes in science and technology can be analyzed using a state-based **model**. In the broadest sense, such a model includes *states*, *transitions* between states, and usually some kind of *output* or way to interact with an environment. Once we have a model, we might want to know if this model *satisfies* certain *properties* or constraints. The process of determining whether a given model satisfies some property is called **model checking**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: The behaviour of a self-driving might can be modeled using a Markov model that behaves exactly like the car. We might then check if the model (and hopefully by extension the actual car) satisfies the property that it will accelerate when a red light is observed."

        "* [Storm](https://www.stormchecker.org/) is a model checker developed at RWTH Aachen University using C/C++. It is currently considered one of the best model checking tools. It is designed in a low-level way that allows users a great level of control over the internal representation of the models. This meams that Storm is very efficient, but also difficult to use.\n",

        "* Stormvogel is a series of APIs and visualization tools for the Storm(py) model checker that are desinged to be easier to use than Stormpy. The goal of Stormvogel is to provide an accessible way to do probabilistic model checking and to provide educational tools about model checking. It is being developped at Radboud University.\n",

        "  - The `model` API can be used to construct a model directly by explicitely defining a set of states and transitions.\n",
        "  - The `pgc` API can be used to construct a model by defining a delta function. The structure is similar to PRISM.\n",
